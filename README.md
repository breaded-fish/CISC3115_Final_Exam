# CISC3115_Final_Exam

## Summary
This program was created a final exam for CISC3115. The gist of this program was a theoretical full bank account program. The main purpose of writing this program was to implement all the concepts of Java within the course into a big program.

## How to run
To run this code you must have all Java files and the two text files. 

`Main.java` is the driver or head of this program. You can run it get into the User Interface.

## How it works
As stated before `Main.java` is the driver of which contains the User interface. `BankAccount.java` is where the main code is stored. `SavingsAccount.java` is the implementation of `BankAccount.java` with different options of course.

`NegativeAmountEntered.java`,`InsufficientFund.java`, and `AccountNotFound.java` are customized Exceptions. 

`Interest.java`a simply add interests.

`myAccts.txt` are preloaded account data.

`myOutput.txt` would be what the accounts would look like in an output.

## Improvements

This code was made when I first started learning Java. One thing that definitely needs improvement would be how the code is organized. While this code does what it was designed to do, its obviously doesn't compare to what actual code is supposed to look like.
